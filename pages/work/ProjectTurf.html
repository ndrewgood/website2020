<h1>Project Turf</h1>
<h2>Better incentivizing people to recycle and clean up their communities</h2>

<p>Fall 2019</p>
<p>Timeframe: 10 weeks</p>
<p>Group Members: Andrew Goodridge, <a href="https:/nicks.cool/" target="_blank">Nick Taormina</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aparna-s-255796135/" target="_blank">Aparna Somvanshi</a></p>
<p>Primary role: Visual design, Vision video</p>

<div class="halfBreak"></div>
<p>This project was made for BC Hwang's Human/Computer Interaction class at SCAD. It was a 10 week project which went through the entire UX process. My group and I worked together in every stage of the process, however I was primarily responsible for the visual design(identity and UI design) and the vision video. For an entire process book of this, use the link at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>After deciding to focus on the problem area of <strong>"Recycling in America"</strong>, we spent multiple weeks going through extensive research, gathering as many insights as we could to help shape the digtal product we would eventually make.
  <div class="halfBreak"></div>
  <div class="fullWidthImage ph400" style="background-image: url(../../assets/img/pt-survey.png);"></div>
<p class="caption">Highlights from our general survey</p>
<p><strong>General Survey:</strong> We first created a general survey to understand the general populations understanding and opinions on recycling. Some of the major insights we gather from this was that people are widely more motivated to recycle from the moral aspect than any monetary reward and that people are still very confused about recycling in general</p>
<div class="halfBreak"></div>
<div class="fullWidthImage ph400" style="background-image: url(../../assets/img/pt-watch.png);"></div>
<p class="caption">Town watching data from Foxy Loxy Cafe</p>
<p><strong>Town Watching:</strong> Multiple town watching experiments at various locations were conducted to analyze the behavior of recycling in public spaces. Our main insight from these tests were that there is often an issue with both classification of the receptacles and incentives to focus on the act of recycling, which end with people using which ever receptacles is easiest for them.</p>
<div class="halfBreak"></div>
<p><strong>Ethnography:</strong> To further develop our understanding of the current status of recycling, we did primary and secondary research on how different cultures around the world recycle. One insight we found out was that most first-world countries further their seperation of trash beyond a general recycling bin.</p>
<div class="halfBreak"></div>
<div class="fullWidthImage ph500" style="background-image: url(../../assets/img/pt-ca.png);"></div>
<p class="caption">Competitor analysis of different physical recycling products</p>
<p><strong>Competitor Analysis:</strong> We researched both physical and digital products which were in the same problem space that we were in. We were not only inspired by the many innovative ideas which currently exist, but we also understood some of the major setbacks of the current products.</p>

<p class="caption">Forsyth park, where we conducted most of our user interviews</p>
<p><strong>User Interview:</strong> As one of our last and most important research methods to our project, we went out in public and asked volunteers multiple questions specific to their opinions on recycling in public and what kinds of incentives would be most effective. We found out that an overwhelming amount of people want to understand and see their impact from recycling, both towards the environment and their community. They also agreed with the idea of having a competitve aspect to recycling, as it is generally a fun and natural incentive.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
<p>After collecting all of our data, we created an affinity map to derive ideas and insights with what specific problems to solve and how to organize them.</p>
<div class="fullWidthImage ph500" style="background-image: url(../../assets/img/pt-affinity.png);"></div>
<div class="fullWidthImage ph500" style="background-image: url(../../assets/img/pt-affinity2.png);"></div>

<p><strong>5 Whys:</strong> After affinity mapping, we did a "5 Whys" exercise in which we asked questions to try and get to the root of our problem.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<h3>Personas and Journey Maps</h3>
<p>To visualize who are product should and shouldn't target, we created a collection of personas. We also created user journey maps to fully understand the scope of behaviors that our users will be having and any pain points with those behaviors.</p>
<div class="fullWidthImage ph400" style="background-image: url(../../assets/img/pt-persona.png);"></div>

<p class="caption">One of our four user journey maps that we created</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<h3>Wireframing</h3>
<p>Once we understood our target audience and what solutions we wanted to create for the problems we were trying to solve, we started ideating, creating an information architecture and eventually wireframes for our app.</p>
<div class="fullWidthImage ph400" style="background-image: url(../../assets/img/pt-sitemap.png);"></div>

<p class="caption">Inital lo-fi sketches and wireframes for our app.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<h3>User Testing and Mid-fi</h3>
<p>Once we got feedback from our lo-fi interfaces, we created a Mid-fi version of our product and created a prototype of it to use for user testing. We also created a lo-fi version of our physical prototype and had users go through a mock version of the behavior a typical user would go through. We gathered many insights from these tests, which shaped our final product.</p>

<p class="caption">Demostration and feedback from our physical process.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<h3>Identity</h3>
<p>Throughout the process of creating interfaces, we also were developing an identity for our product. We wanted it to feel friendly and inviting so that those who walk by and see Project Turf recycling bins would be intrigued to join in.</p>
